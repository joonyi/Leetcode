"""
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the
border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and
it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are
connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
